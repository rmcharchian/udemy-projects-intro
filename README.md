Udemy Build 10 AngularJS Projects - Projects Intro

#The Plan
I graduated from Prime last week, and my plan is to keep building on my knowledge of AngularJS.  I found a Udemy class that builds 10 projects and this is the intro.  I'm not sure how much actual code will be in this, but would like to keep it organized.
